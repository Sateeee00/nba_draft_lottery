# 🏀 Is the NBA Draft Lottery Rigged? A Statistical Deep Dive

This project investigates the fairness of the NBA Draft Lottery system using probability theory, Monte Carlo simulations, and historical data from 2019 to 2025. Inspired by popular conspiracy theories and recent lottery outcomes (like Dallas landing the 1st pick in 2025), this notebook explores whether statistical anomalies exist — or whether the lottery is, in fact, fair.
